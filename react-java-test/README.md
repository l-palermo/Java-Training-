# React Java Test App

The app is built using React for the frontend and Springboot/Java for the backend.

The front end has 3 components:
* App - This is the parent component that uses **Browser routes** to route the two other child components. It uses **Lazy load** to render the components.
* FirstRoute - This app fetches data from the backend and display it on the page.
* SecondRoute - Does the same as the one above but fecthes different data.

The **pom.xml** file has been modified using two plugins:
* frontend-maven-plugin.version 1.7.6 - This plugin installs node and npm to run the build in react.
* maven-antrun-plugin - This Plugin copies the react build folder into the ${target/classes/public} that is the static folder in spring boot. 

Thanks to these two plugins the frontend is served by the spring-boot server.

Running **mvn package** and then **java -jar target/react-java-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar** we can run directly the built of the whole app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
